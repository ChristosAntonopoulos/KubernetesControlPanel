- **PodResourceUsage**: Historical resource usage data
- **ContainerMetrics**: Per-container resource information

#### Enhanced Services
- **Previous log retrieval** with Kubernetes API
- **Metrics collection** (requires metrics-server)
- **Log preservation** during restart operations
- **Historical data simulation** (can be replaced with time-series DB)

- **Error handling** and loading states

## üìã Usage Instructions

### Pod Management Workflow

1. **View Pods**: Access the Pods page to see all pods with filtering options
2. **Select Actions**: Click the three-dot menu next to any pod for available actions
3. **Monitor Logs**: Use the log viewer for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting
4. **Check Metrics**: View resource usage to identify performance issues
5. **Restart Safely**: Use restart-with-logs for troubleshooting while preserving evidence
6. **Delete Carefully**: Remove pods with confirmation to prevent accidents

### Log Management

1. **Access Logs**: Select "View Logs" from the pod actions menu
2. **Configure View**: Choose container, tail lines, and current/previous instance
3. **Search & Filter**: Use the search bar to find specific log entries
4. **Download**: Save logs locally for offline analysis
5. **Monitor Real-time**: Enable auto-refresh and follow mode for live monitoring

### Metrics Monitoring

1. **View Current State**: Check real-time CPU and memory usage
2. **Analyze Trends**: Select different time periods for historical analysis
3. **Compare Containers**: Review per-container resource consumption
4. **Identify Issues**: Use charts to spot resource spikes or trends

## üîß Configuration Requirements

### Kubernetes Cluster Setup
- **Metrics Server**: Required for resource metrics collection
- **RBAC Permissions**: Ensure service account has proper pod management permissions
- **Resource Quotas**: Consider setting appropriate limits for pod resources

### Optional Enhancements
- **Time-series Database**: Replace simulated historical data with Prometheus/InfluxDB
- **Log Aggregation**: Integrate with ELK stack or similar for advanced log analysis
- **Alerting**: Add notifications for pod failures or resource thresholds
- **Auto-scaling**: Integrate with HPA/VPA recommendations

## üö¶ Current Limitations

1. **Historical Metrics**: Currently simulated; requires integration with metrics storage
2. **Log Retention**: Limited by Kubernetes log retention policies
3. **Real-time Streaming**: Log streaming uses polling rather than WebSocket
4. **Metrics Server Dependency**: Requires metrics-server for resource data
5. **Simulated Data**: Some features use simulated data for demonstration

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **WebSocket log streaming** for true real-time updates
- **Advanced filtering** with regex and time-based filters
- **Bulk operations** for managing multiple pods
- **Resource recommendations** based on usage patterns
- **Integration with monitoring tools** (Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Pod scheduling insights** and node affinity information
- **Network policy visualization** and security insights

### Extended Functionality
- **Deployment management** with rollback capabilities
- **ConfigMap and Secret management** 
- **Service and Ingress management**
- **Namespace-level operations** and resource quotas
- **Cluster-level monitoring** and health checks

## üéØ Benefits
